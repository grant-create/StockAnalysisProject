# StockAnalysisProject

This should create a list of stocks that have closed under their 20-day rolling average.

The idea is that this is a buy indicator as they (hopefully) will drift back towards the average.

These stocks are also those who have closed with a price under $50. Though, that can be changed on line 67.

I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice.
